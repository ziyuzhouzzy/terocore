2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell control_inst/DFF_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) counter_inst/counter[0].tff/DFF/CLR, counter_inst/counter[1].tff/DFF/CLR, counter_inst/counter[2].tff/DFF/CLR, counter_inst/counter[3].tff/DFF/CLR, counter_inst/counter[4].tff/DFF/CLR, counter_inst/counter[5].tff/DFF/CLR, counter_inst/counter[6].tff/DFF/CLR, counter_inst/counter[7].tff/DFF/CLR, counter_inst/counter[8].tff/DFF/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
