2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
LUTLP-1#1 Critical Warning
Combinatorial Loop Alert  
2 LUT cells form a combinatorial loop. This can create a race condition. Timing analysis may not be accurate. The preferred resolution is to modify the design to remove combinatorial logic loops. If the loop is known and understood, this DRC can be bypassed by acknowledging the condition and setting the following XDC constraint on any one of the nets in the loop: 'set_property ALLOW_COMBINATORIAL_LOOPS TRUE [get_nets <myHier/myNet>]'. One net in the loop is tero_inst/N1/in0[0]. Please evaluate your design. The cells in the loop are: tero_inst/N1/LUT6_inst, tero_inst/N2/LUT6_inst.
Related violations: <none>

NSTD-1#1 Critical Warning
Unspecified I/O Standard  
18 out of 18 logical ports use I/O standard (IOSTANDARD) value 'DEFAULT', instead of a user assigned specific value. This may cause I/O contention or incompatibility with the board power or connectivity affecting performance, signal integrity or in extreme cases cause damage to the device or the components to which it is connected. To correct this violation, specify all I/O standards. This design will fail to generate a bitstream unless all logical ports have a user specified I/O standard value defined. To allow bitstream creation with unspecified I/O standard values (not recommended), use this command: set_property SEVERITY {Warning} [get_drc_checks NSTD-1].  NOTE: When using the Vivado Runs infrastructure (e.g. launch_runs Tcl command), add this command to a .tcl file and add that file as a pre-hook for write_bitstream step for the implementation run. Problem ports: osc_number[7:0], randbyte[7:0], clk, rst.
Related violations: <none>

UCIO-1#1 Critical Warning
Unconstrained Logical Port  
18 out of 18 logical ports have no user assigned specific location constraint (LOC). This may cause I/O contention or incompatibility with the board power or connectivity affecting performance, signal integrity or in extreme cases cause damage to the device or the components to which it is connected. To correct this violation, specify all pin locations. This design will fail to generate a bitstream unless all logical ports have a user specified site LOC constraint defined.  To allow bitstream creation with unspecified pin locations (not recommended), use this command: set_property SEVERITY {Warning} [get_drc_checks UCIO-1].  NOTE: When using the Vivado Runs infrastructure (e.g. launch_runs Tcl command), add this command to a .tcl file and add that file as a pre-hook for write_bitstream step for the implementation run.  Problem ports: osc_number[7:0], randbyte[7:0], clk, rst.
Related violations: <none>

PDCN-1569#1 Warning
LUT equation term check  
Used physical LUT pin 'A1' of cell tero_inst/N1/LUT6_inst is not included in the LUT equation: 'O6=(A5*(~A6))+((~A5))'. If this cell is a user instantiated LUT in the design, please remove connectivity to the pin or change the equation and/or INIT string of the LUT to prevent this issue. If the cell is inferred or IP created LUT, please regenerate the IP and/or resynthesize the design to attempt to correct the issue.
Related violations: <none>

PDCN-1569#2 Warning
LUT equation term check  
Used physical LUT pin 'A1' of cell tero_inst/N2/LUT6_inst is not included in the LUT equation: 'O6=(A5*(~A6))+((~A5))'. If this cell is a user instantiated LUT in the design, please remove connectivity to the pin or change the equation and/or INIT string of the LUT to prevent this issue. If the cell is inferred or IP created LUT, please regenerate the IP and/or resynthesize the design to attempt to correct the issue.
Related violations: <none>

PDCN-1569#3 Warning
LUT equation term check  
Used physical LUT pin 'A2' of cell tero_inst/N1/LUT6_inst is not included in the LUT equation: 'O6=(A5*(~A6))+((~A5))'. If this cell is a user instantiated LUT in the design, please remove connectivity to the pin or change the equation and/or INIT string of the LUT to prevent this issue. If the cell is inferred or IP created LUT, please regenerate the IP and/or resynthesize the design to attempt to correct the issue.

PDCN-1569#5 Warning
LUT equation term check  
Used physical LUT pin 'A3' of cell tero_inst/N1/LUT6_inst is not included in the LUT equation: 'O6=(A5*(~A6))+((~A5))'. If this cell is a user instantiated LUT in the design, please remove connectivity to the pin or change the equation and/or INIT string of the LUT to prevent this issue. If the cell is inferred or IP created LUT, please regenerate the IP and/or resynthesize the design to attempt to correct the issue.

PDCN-1569#6 Warning
LUT equation term check  
Used physical LUT pin 'A3' of cell tero_inst/N2/LUT6_inst is not included in the LUT equation: 'O6=(A5*(~A6))+((~A5))'.

PDCN-1569#7 Warning
LUT equation term check  
Used physical LUT pin 'A4' of cell tero_inst/N1/LUT6_inst is not included in the LUT equation: 'O6=(A5*(~A6))+((~A5))'. If this cell is a user instantiated LUT in the design, please remove connectivity to the pin or change the equation and/or INIT string of the LUT to prevent this issue.

PDCN-1569#8 Warning
LUT equation term check

Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net tero_inst/N1/in0[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin tero_inst/N1/LUT6_inst/O, cell tero_inst/N1/LUT6_inst. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#1 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT tero_inst/N1/LUT6_inst is driving clock pin of 1 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
counter_inst/counter[0].tff/DFF
Related violations: <none>

ZPS7-1#1 Warning
PS7 block required  
The PS7 cell must be used in this Zynq design in order to enable correct default configuration.
Related violations: <none>
